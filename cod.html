	<img class="img" src="images/ghosts.png" alt="Cover for Call of Duty Ghosts">
	<ul>
		<li>First COD game I watched someone play</li>
		<li>Interesting story mode, although the constant time jumps are annoying</li>
		<li>Characters arcs for the characters were amazing</li>
		<li>The graphics are suprisingly good for an 11-year old game</li>
		<li>Left players wanting another game. However, it's been 11 years</li>
		<li>Eminem made a song for the credits</li>
		<li>I just like playing this game more than the others</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>2. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, 2009</h3>
	<img class="img" src="images/ogmw.jpg" alt="Cover for Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, 2009">
	<ul>
		<li>It may be old, but it's a banger of a game</li>
		<li>The story line was amazing</li>
		<li>Character design was also amazing</li>
		<li>You'll hear about people talk about this game a lot</li>
		<li>The ending gets me every time</li>
		<li>Well known for "Remember: No Russian"</li>
		<li>Nostalgic in a "I miss those times" way and not an "I'm old" way</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	
	<section class="cod_mw2">
	<h3>3. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, 2022</h3>

		<li>The actors for the game just fit the characters</li>
		<li>The story line is amazing, easy to follow</li>
		<li>Not quite like the 2009 game</li>
		<li>A lot of dialog choices and hidden gems everywhere</li>
		<li>The cutscenes are beautifully filmed</li>
		<li>A remake of the 2009 game, but with changed story line</li>
